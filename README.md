# WIP!
Will eventually be a nice simple intro to me. :blush:

I recently received an email from Google Domains telling me that mine will renew in 30 days.

This made me realise I've had it for a year and not used it. :grimacing:

So I _had_ to knock something simple and cute together! :sparkles:

I've also tried to use this simple site as an oppurtunity to look into and practise accessible development, which has been really cool!
